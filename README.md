# Neural network
Implementation of neural network for digits recognition. Application consist of four modules:
1. Nauka (English: teaching) – implementation of  neural network
2. Wzorce (English: patterns) – application for drawing digits (patterns)
3. Test – application for testing trained neural network in digits recognition.
4. Matrix – shared OLE control used by Wzorce and Test apps.

I wrote this application on studies in 1998 in C++ language. It works!
I cyrfry.doc (English: digits) there are results. For example how fast neural network learned patterns with different number of neurons.
